						<p>Thank you for reading this.  I want to recognize the importance of that.  The &quot;if a tree falls in the woods and there&#39;s no one there to hear it, is there a sound?&quot; question applies equally to written words.  If there is no one reading them, are bits and bytes really words?  How much of existence is in quantum superposition, decohered into concreteness only when <em>you</em> see it?  Thank you for decohering this writing into concrete existence.</p>
<p>There are so many things and processes, <em>so</em> many, that have come together in known and unknown ways to allow my writing and your reading of these words.</p>
<p>There&#39;s an earth, holding up a chair for me to sit on while I write these words.  Probably it&#39;s still there, holding up a chair for you to sit on while you read these words.  In a mind-blowing double-take that same earth is also holding me down onto the chair so I don&#39;t fly off into space.  Unless you are an astronaut reading this in space (if so, please email me immediately and let me know because that would be most rad) then you likely also have the immense good fortune to be firmly rooted to your chair.  Thank you earth.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a glass of water next to me.  That water is keeping me well hydrated while I write.  It&#39;s actually the same water that kept the dinosaurs well hydrated.  Let me repeat that, <em>the same water</em>.  Also true of the water in your glass (you are staying hydrated right?).  In fact, the water in your glass and the water in my glass have probably been <em>frequently</em> in the same body of water, possibly even right next to each other.  Maybe you think that&#39;s gross.  <em>I</em> think that is totally rad.  Thank you water.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a whole host of beings that live in the water.  What do fish have to do with the reading of these words.  I have no idea.  Google it.  Ah, that reminds me, <em>the engineers that build google are descendants of fish</em>.  Thank you fish.</p>
<p>There&#39;s an entire kingdom of plants (<em>Plantae</em>).  For breakfast today I ate some plants (rice, bok choy, sweet potato).  For lunch I ate some plants (wheat, peanuts).  For dinner I ate some plants (potatoes, kale, wheat, garlic, avocados, onions).  I also ate some animals, but those animals are really just old plants in disguise.  In fact, I&#39;m just old plants in disguise.  In fact <em>these words are just old plants</em> in disguise.  Thank you plants.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a great abundance of wild animals running around in those plants.  First, we humans are actually wild animals running around in plants (though we like to forget it).  Second, paleolithically, our primary interaction with wild animals was through their tracks and sign.  This was a primary driver of our increasing brain power and crucially our ability to give meaning to symbols.  Meaningful symbols are the groundwork for words.  These are words.  Thank you animals.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a great many forests full of trees.  I love trees.  Trees are my favorite beeings. Trees are so crucial to our existence as modern humans that I don&#39;t even know where to start.  As I write this I&#39;m sitting on a chair made out of tree at a table made out of a tree on a floor made out of trees surrounded by walls made out of trees under a roof made out of trees.  The Thanksgiving Address assignment was given to me on a piece of paper made out of a tree.  And these are all from dead trees.  Live trees are even cooler.  Especially here in the PNW.  Holy-fricken-mole.  I would not be sitting here writing words if it weren&#39;t for trees showing me how it&#39;s done.  Thank you trees.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a bird outside the window on the feeder.  Looks like a Junco.  He&#39;s furtively darting between the nearby bush and the feeder.  He doesn&#39;t want to stay on that danjerous feeder for long.  When I poke my head out the door he gives a click and darts into the bush to give some more clicks.  The few other Juncos in the bush shoot over to the tree, letting the Towhees know that the feeder is now unsafe. Distributed, realtime communication of current events.  Likely you aren&#39;t hearing these written words from the birds (though again, if true, email me asap), but likely you are recieving them through our current preferred impementation of a distributed communication network.  Thank you birds.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a gentle breeze outside.  Right now it&#39;s subtle, but sometimes it&#39;s one heck of a great wind.  Air is our primary conduit of sound and wind is how we generate sound.  I wonder if humans started communicating first with visual symbols or auditory symbols?  That&#39;s another question for google. For myself, though, I first learned how to craft words into stories by generating modulated wind through my larynx and recieving realtime feedback via air in my ears. Over time, my stories have evolved into this one.  Thank you wind.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a moon overhead. It&#39;s close to full right now.  Last night the skies were clear and it stood there in its almost fullness, telling me at a glance how far time was through the moon-cycle.  We have a number of cycle patterns on earth.  I happen to be writing right now on a specific day of the month.  That a month can become a globally recognized unit of time is because the moon has been telling us how long a moon-cycle is ever since there was a moon.  Thank you moon.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a sun overhead, keeping me, and everyting else on this earth perfectly warmed. From what I understand, light hitting the earth is what makes it all happen.  Energy hits molecules and weird stuff happens.  Ultimately that wierd stuff becomes you and I and this computer that I&#39;m writing on.  Thank you sun.</p>
<p>There&#39;s an innumerable count of stars beyond the sun.  In addition to their role as navigation aids, the stars also hold space for mystery, and possibility, and new stories.  Each one holds the possibility of countless unknown stories.  We humans are in the business of making the unknown known, but the stars are holding on to the unknown and won&#39;t let go of it easily.  Indeed it was likely the mystery of the unknown that led you to read these words.  Thank you stars.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a great lineage of ancestors, both for you and me.  It would be very hard for me to be writing these words if I did not exist, or for you to be reading them if you did not exist.  Certainly neither of us would be here without parents, or their parents, or their parents, or a very long list of ancestors going back to the beginning of time.  If any of them were missing, these words would be missing.  Thank you ancestors.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a strong probability that there will be many generations that follow us.  We can think of the ancestors as pushing history forward, pushing these words into existence.  We can likewise think of the future generations as pulling history forward, as pulling these words into existence.  They want to have an existence to exist in.  Thank you future generations.</p>
<p>There are the spirits of the four directions.  I&#39;m still working through what those words mean, but for me, those abstract symbols are pointing toward our own personal existential navigation systems.  When I talk about my path in life I&#39;m not talking about walking from here to the grocery store (west, then south), I&#39;m talking about the choices (turns) I make between birth and death.  The spirits of the four directions are the things in life that allow us orient our life path with our heart&#39;s longing.  I&#39;ll readily admit to not alway having my life path in alignment with my hearts longing, but there is indeed some of my heart&#39;s longing in these words.  Perhaps there is some of your heart&#39;s longing in reading these words.  Thank you spirits of the four directions.</p>
<p>There is the great spirit.  Another concept hard to describe, but for me, the great spririt is nothing more, or less, than the ongoing unfolding of the universe.  These words, my writing of them, and your reading of them, are indeed part of the unfolding of the universe.  Thank you great spirit.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a pretty good list of the things and processes that have gone into the writing of these words.  And yet, it barely scratches the surface.  I&#39;ve only named a couple fairly basic and foundational things.  Each of those things are astronomicaly more complex than what I&#39;ve been able to summarize, and there are astronomically more things that could be named.  In fact, to name all of the things and proceses would take more time than the universe has been in existence (the universe, being a conglomoration of parallel processes will run faster than the naming, a sequential process).  And yet, all of those things and processes have existed, and without any of them, this precise moment would not exist.  Thank you for this moment.</p>
