						<p>My name is Jeremiah. I&#39;m a current student of the Anake program class of 2015.
I’d like to introduce myself and tell you the story about how I ended up here.
However, when I tell that story it no longer makes sense because here is not
where I thought it was. Strangely, it&#39;s where I wanted it to be, without
knowing. I&#39;m really not sure how I ended up here, but with great fortune it&#39;s
exactly where I need to be. Clear as the fresh spring waters of the Cascades?
No doubt.</p>
<p>This year is shaping up to be fairly radical. As such, I’m feeling drawn to
share some of this experience with you (who are you? I do not know). But before
I really get into sharing some of the experiences of this year (in subsequent
posts), I want to give a bit of an overview of what the Anake program is from
my perspective.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve finished up just about two months of class. And as you can undoubtedly
imagine I&#39;m now qualified to tell you exactly what this program is about (this
is not true). What they don&#39;t tell you about Anake (or, more accurately, what
they didn&#39;t tell me, since clearly I&#39;m about to tell you) is that the best
possible description of it is that it is a ride on an interstellar
rocket-missile cruising through space at warp speed.</p>
<p>The first thing you do is blast off.</p>
<p>The second thing you do is say &quot;holy-mole I&#39;m on a rocket ship, this is so
cool, I&#39;ve always wanted to be on a rocket ship, rocket ships are rad.&quot;</p>
<p>The third thing you do is say &quot;Actually, I don&#39;t like rocket ships, I’m getting
motion sickness, the interstellar is so far away, we aren’t going anywhere,
space is just way too big, where did I put my wormhole device?&quot;</p>
<p>The fourth thing you do is say &quot;rocketships are rad...&quot;</p>
<p>The fifth thing you do is say &quot;wait a minute? I&#39;m on a rocket ship in the
middle of space? No bueno. What if this thing malfunctions? We could all die or
start eating each other.&quot;</p>
<p>The sixth thing you do is say &quot;the interstellar is rad...&quot;</p>
<p>Then you wake up and realize it was all a dream. It&#39;s a school day so you head
up to Linne Doran for class. You&#39;re clan is clan of the day so you get to work
together to bust a friction fire and then help gather everyone for a fun day in
the woods. After bringing the circle of Anakes together with a song you pass it
off to the instructors so they can start up the lesson for the day.</p>
<p>Marcus looks into the fire for a while and then introduces the day&#39;s activity:
&quot;Everyone take a deep breath...this morning we&#39;ll be building an interstellar
rocket-missile out of cedar logs and sword ferns.”</p>
