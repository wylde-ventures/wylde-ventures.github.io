						<p>Thank you for reading this.  I want to recognize the importance of that.  The &quot;if a tree falls in the woods and there&#39;s no one there to hear it, is there a sound?&quot; question applies equally to blogs.  If there is no one reading them are bits and bytes really words?  How much of existence is in quantum super-position, decohered into concreteness only when you see it?  Thank you for decohering this writing into concrete existence.</p>
<p>There are so many things and processes, <em>so</em> many, that have come together in known and unknown ways to allow my writing and your reading of these words.</p>
<p>There&#39;s an earth, holding up a chair for me to sit on while I write these words.  Probably it&#39;s still there, holding up a chair for you to sit on while you read these words.  In a mind-blowing double-take that same earth is also holding me down onto the chair so I don&#39;t fly off into space.  Unless you are an astronaut reading this in space (if so, please email me immediately and let me know because that would be most rad) then you likely also have the immense good fortune to be firmly rooted to your chair.  Thank you earth.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a glass of water next to me.  That water is keeping me well hydrated while I write.  It&#39;s actually the same water that kept the dinosaurs well hydrated.  Let me repeat that, <em>the same water</em>.  Also true of the water in your glass (you are staying hydrated right?).  In fact, the water in your glass and the water in my glass have probably been <em>frequently</em> in the same body of water, possibly even right next to each other.  Maybe you think that&#39;s gross.  <em>I</em> think that is totally rad.  Thank you water.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a whole host of beings that live in the water.  What the hell to do fish have to do with the reading of these words.  I have no idea.  Google it.  Ah, that reminds me, <em>the engineers that build google are descendants of fish</em>.  Thank you fish.</p>
<p>There&#39;s an entire kingdom of plants (<em>Plantae</em>).  For breakfast today I ate some plants (rice, bok choy, sweet potato).  For lunch I ate some plants (wheat, peanuts).  For dinner I ate some plants (potatoes, kale, wheat, garlic, avocados, onions).  I also ate some animals, but those animals are really just old plants in disguise.  In fact, I&#39;m just old plants in disguise.  In fact <em>these words are just old plants</em> in disguise.  Thank you plants.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a great abundance of wild animals running around in those plants.  First, we humans are actually wild animals running around in plants (though we like to forget it).  Second, paleolithically, our primary interaction with wild animals was through their tracks and sign.  This was a primary driver of our increasing brain power and crucially our ability to give meaning to symbols.  Meaningful symbols are the groundwork for words.  These are words.  Thank you animals.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a great many forests full of trees.  I love trees.  Trees are my favorite beeings. Trees are so crucial to our existence as modern humans that I don&#39;t even know where to start.  As I write this I&#39;m sitting on a chair made out of tree at a table made out of a tree on a floor made out of trees surrounded by walls made out of trees under a roof made out of trees.  The Thanksgiving Address assignment was given to me on a piece of paper made out of a tree.  And these are all from dead trees.  Live trees are even cooler.  Especially here in the PNW.  Holy-fricken-mole.  I would not be sitting here writing words if it weren&#39;t for trees showing me how it&#39;s done.  Thank you trees.</p>
