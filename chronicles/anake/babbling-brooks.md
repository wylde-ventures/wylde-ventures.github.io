Babbling Brooks

"When you go to your Sit Spot do a sense meditation first thing."

Okay, what's a sense meditation?  Resources were initially slim on this one and no two people seem to describe it in exactly the same way.  I like to describe it like this: "Pay attention to your senses."  I initially wrote "Stop moving and pay attention to your senses."  But I think the "stop moving" part is actually optional.  The core of the thing for me is having my awareness include as much current moment sensory data as possible.

There have been a very small number of times in my life where I've had the experience of my awareness being comepletely (as far as I can tell) non-separate from my current moment sensory experience.  These moments also seem to correspond to a strong sense of well-being.  This sense of well-being is a pretty powerful carrot and I have a tendency to make these moments into benchmark target experiences.  That tendency is a sharp two-edged sword.  It gives me motivation to cultivate practices that may move me toward future such moments.  Intentionally doing "a sense meditation" falls into the category of cultivating practices that may move me toward moments of well-being. The other edge to the sword is that those moments are punctuated with a definite lack of wanting.  And wanting a lack of wanting is a wicked catch-22.

I haven't figured out that catch-22.  So in the interim I'll just accept that I want experiences of well-being and give cultivation pratices a good try.

I found a good dose of extra inspiration in the reading materials associated with the exercise.  I read a story about Ingwe being able to hear a fresh water spring in the woods that the storyteller was unable to hear.  This idea - that there is potentially much more information coming through my senses than I'm generally aware of **and** that this awareness could feasibly be expanded - is very inspirational and motivational to me.

This story also made experiential awareness somehow more concrete for me.  Instead of being this abstract idea of "being more aware" it became "being able to hear the spring in the woods."  Shortly after this I noticed (+1 awareness points already) that on the way to my sit spot I **always** first noticed the creek that I cross over on my way there with my eyes.  As soon as I saw it I noticed that I could certainly hear it and hear it well.  But when, I asked myself, do I start hearing it?  Is there creek sound entering my ears when I'm further away?  If so, why don't I notice that?  And how far away from the creek does the creek sound travel?  So many questions.

I challenged myself to notice the creek by sound before sight.  The next couple times I was headed to my sit spot I found that I still noticed it by sight first.  In fact, I didn't remember that I was attempting to notice the creek by sound first until I saw the creek.  Then it would be "oh crap, I forgot to notice the creek sooner."

I was also trying something else however.  After I noticed the creek with my eyes, I would keep walking past it and try to notice how long I could continue to hear the creek sound for.  The first time I did this I walked 20 feet and couldn't hear the creek.  This seemed like a rediculously unexceptable level of awareness so I stoped walking and tried to listen really hard for the creek.  After a bit of intentional listening I found that I could indeed hear the creek. Another ten feet and I couldn't hear it again.  But after another bit of intentional listening I could hear it, but it was just a bit trickier.

After I could really not hear it, even after some hard listening, I would proceed to my sit spot and do whatever it is that I did there, including a sense meditation.

On the way back from my spot I found that I heard the stream before I saw it.  And, to my great surprise, I heard it when I was substantially further away from it than I had last heard it when I had been walking away from it.  I immediately had to wonder if my sense meditaion had been more effective than it seemed.

Eventually I remembered to listen for the stream on my way to my sit spot.  At first I wasn't able to hear it from very far away.  But over the course of a few visits I challenged myself to stop and try to hear it from a bit farther away.  And lo and behold the distance at which I could start to hear the stream began to increase.

What has occured to me, and this is fascinating, is that I previously didn't actually know what the stream sounded like.  Since I didn't know what it sounded like there was no way I could hear it before I saw it.  I mean, really, I knew what a stream sounds like.  I've heard lots of streams in my day.  But either I didn't know what **this** stream sounded like.  Or I didn't know what pieces of the sound of a stream sounded like.  And when you are further away and there are other noises all you might hear is a piece of a stream sound.  Now I know a bit more what the components of stream sound are, so I might hear just one babble and realize, "oh, a babbling brook."  

Rumor on the street is that this kind of intentional awareness work encourages the mind to develop a search pattern for "babbling brook" so that it is (a) easier to parse that sound out of the chaos that enters your ears, and (b) possible that the "babbling brook" sound will pop into your awareness without intentional listening.  Which is exactly what has started to happen to me.  I'm no longer intentionally listening for the stream on the way to my sit spot.  But I hear it almost every time, long before I see it.  Sometimes I hear it not long after I walk out of my house.

Pretty F.ing badass if you ask me.

(I would give myself +19 awareness points, but it now rains quite a bit more then when I started this exercise and the vegetation has become winter sparse, so the stream is actually louder now than it was, so maybe +3 points for the stream and +2 points for noticing the rain, and +2 for the vegetation.)
