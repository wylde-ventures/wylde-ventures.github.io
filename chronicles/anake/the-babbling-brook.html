						<p>&quot;When you go to your Sit Spot do a sense meditation first thing.&quot;</p>
<p>Okay, what&#39;s a sense meditation?  Resources were initially slim on this one and no two people seem to describe it in exactly the same way.  I like to describe it like this: &quot;Pay attention to your senses.&quot;  I initially wrote &quot;Stop moving and pay attention to your senses.&quot;  But I think the &quot;stop moving&quot; part is actually optional.  The core of the thing for me is having my awareness include as much current moment sensory data as possible.</p>
<p>There have been a very small number of times in my life where I&#39;ve had the experience of my awareness being comepletely (as far as I can tell) non-separate from my current moment sensory experience.  These moments also seem to correspond to a strong sense of well-being.  This sense of well-being is a pretty powerful carrot and I have a tendency to make these moments into benchmark target experiences.  That tendency is a sharp two-edged sword.  It gives me motivation to cultivate practices that may move me toward future such moments.  Intentionally doing &quot;a sense meditation&quot; falls into the category of cultivating practices that may move me toward moments of well-being. The other edge to the sword is that those moments are punctuated with a definite lack of wanting.  And wanting a lack of wanting is a wicked catch-22.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t figured out that catch-22.  So in the interim I&#39;ll just accept that I want experiences of well-being and give cultivation pratices a good try.</p>
<p>I found a good dose of extra inspiration in the reading materials associated with the exercise.  I read a story about Ingwe being able to hear a fresh water spring in the woods that the storyteller was unable to hear.  This idea - that there is potentially much more information coming through my senses than I&#39;m generally aware of <strong>and</strong> that this awareness could feasibly be expanded - is very inspirational and motivational to me.</p>
<p>This story also made experiential awareness somehow more concrete for me.  Instead of being this abstract idea of &quot;being more aware&quot; it became &quot;being able to hear the spring in the woods.&quot;  Shortly after this I noticed (+1 awareness points already) that on the way to my sit spot I <strong>always</strong> first noticed the creek that I cross over on my way there with my eyes.  As soon as I saw it I noticed that I could certainly hear it and hear it well.  But when, I asked myself, do I start hearing it?  Is there creek sound entering my ears when I&#39;m further away?  If so, why don&#39;t I notice that?  And how far away from the creek does the creek sound travel?  So many questions.</p>
<p>I challenged myself to notice the creek by sound before sight.  The next couple times I was headed to my sit spot I found that I still noticed it by sight first.  In fact, I didn&#39;t remember that I was attempting to notice the creek by sound first until I saw the creek.  Then it would be &quot;oh crap, I forgot to notice the creek sooner.&quot;</p>
<p>I was also trying something else however.  After I noticed the creek with my eyes, I would keep walking past it and try to notice how long I could continue to hear the creek sound for.  The first time I did this I walked 20 feet and couldn&#39;t hear the creek.  This seemed like a rediculously unexceptable level of awareness so I stoped walking and tried to listen really hard for the creek.  After a bit of intentional listening I found that I could indeed hear the creek. Another ten feet and I couldn&#39;t hear it again.  But after another bit of intentional listening I could hear it, but it was just a bit trickier.</p>
<p>After I could really not hear it, even after some hard listening, I would proceed to my sit spot and do whatever it is that I did there, including a sense meditation.</p>
<p>On the way back from my spot I found that I heard the stream before I saw it.  And, to my great surprise, I heard it when I was substantially further away from it than I had last heard it when I had been walking away from it.  I immediately had to wonder if my sense meditaion had been more effective than it seemed.</p>
<p>Eventually I remembered to listen for the stream on my way to my sit spot.  At first I wasn&#39;t able to hear it from very far away.  But over the course of a few visits I challenged myself to stop and try to hear it from a bit farther away.  And lo and behold the distance at which I could start to hear the stream began to increase.</p>
<p>What has occured to me, and this is fascinating, is that I previously didn&#39;t actually know what the stream sounded like.  Since I didn&#39;t know what it sounded like there was no way I could hear it before I saw it.  I mean, really, I knew what a stream sounds like.  I&#39;ve heard lots of streams in my day.  But either I didn&#39;t know what <strong>this</strong> stream sounded like.  Or I didn&#39;t know what pieces of the sound of a stream sounded like.  And when you are further away and there are other noises all you might hear is a piece of a stream sound.  Now I know a bit more what the components of stream sound are, so I might hear just one babble and realize, &quot;oh, a babbling brook.&quot;  </p>
<p>Rumor on the street is that this kind of intentional awareness work encourages the mind to develop a search pattern for &quot;babbling brook&quot; so that it is (a) easier to parse that sound out of the chaos that enters your ears, and (b) possible that the &quot;babbling brook&quot; sound will pop into your awareness without intentional listening.  Which is exactly what has started to happen to me.  I&#39;m no longer intentionally listening for the stream on the way to my sit spot.  But I hear it almost every time, long before I see it.  Sometimes I hear it not long after I walk out of my house.</p>
<p>Pretty F.ing badass if you ask me.</p>
<p>(I would give myself +19 awareness points, but it now rains quite a bit more then when I started this exercise and the vegetation has become winter sparse, so the stream is actually louder now than it was, so maybe +3 points for the stream and +2 points for noticing the rain, and +2 for the vegetation.)</p>
