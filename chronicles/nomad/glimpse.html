						<p>Getting off a bus at the end of a long ride is always a surreal experience.
Time ceases to exist while on a bus that travels through the day and night. You
can&#39;t figure out when to sleep and you can&#39;t sleep when you want. Eventually
you can&#39;t remember how long its been since you started, or where you started.
The outside world becomes a shadowy blur passing by through tinted windows. And
the fact that you once walked that world becomes a distant memory, or a dream.
The upshot of this is when I got off the bus a little over a week ago in Iron
River, Michigan at 5AM in the &quot;morning&quot; I had little idea where I was, what I
was doing, or even if I was awake or not.</p>
<p>Iron River, Michigan is pretty dark at 5AM and very deserted. Its a small
enough town that streetlights are few and far between (and flickering) and gas
stations are not open 24 hours. It&#39;s a town towards the far end of bus lines,
nestled on the far western side of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan right next
to Wisconsin. I&#39;d been the only one on the bus for the last 4 hours or so, and
according to the bus driver, that wasn&#39;t abnormal at all for this part of the
country. The word remote was invented in the next town over. Now if your asking
what in tarnation I was doing there you&#39;re asking the same question I was
asking myself in the wee hours of that morning. But before we can understand
that we&#39;re going to have to look at a little bit of (my) history.</p>
<p>Two epiphanies have occurred in the last two years of my life the aftermath of
which are largely responsible for my current direction. The first happened
about 2 years ago. Here is an excerpt from my journal from October 20th, 2008
which happened to be a monday (maybe my whole life philosophy is now just a
hooped up case of the mondays.. :-):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And woa! I&#39;m also just now considering some major life changes: sell off all
my extraneous shit. Sell the iMac. Sell off my DPS skis. Keep only one pair.
Sell off anything else that I don&#39;t need, give away all my junk. Streamline my
life. I&#39;m currently living in full realization that my current life is not
ideal - why should I keep fucking around? Do I have the will power to do this?
Because I may not find my true path until I get rid of the maze that is my
current life. Just do it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you can&#39;t read it in there, I was pretty surprised to find my self writing
those words. And while I didn&#39;t immediately act on those thoughts the seed was
planted and a year later I found myself amazingly leaving Utah jobless and
homeless with the sum total of my belongings on my back and approximately no
idea where I was going or what I was doing. Which leads me to epiphany number
two which happened shortly after I left Utah. This epiphany happened to me on a
beautiful rocky river while I was taking a fitness course in West Virginia and
is mentioned in my journal with only the following line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Knowing the woods are for me and I am for the woods.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This time the thought didn&#39;t seem like a surprise so much as a realization of a
fact I had known but forgotten for quite some time. Even still the results of
the thought were not immediately apparent and are in fact still culminating.
The thought, however, certainly began a questioning and exploration of the
natural realm and my relationship to it. Since I was a child I&#39;ve been drawn to
the woods but this time the draw seemed different. The more I questioned and
explored in this direction the more I felt compelled to experience the
wilderness and a real relationship with it. But the more I experienced the
wilderness the more frustrated I became with my inability to enter into the
relationship with it that I felt was innate to the wilderness itself - one of
harmony with itself. I was constantly getting poison ivy or being driven away
by mosquitos or injury. I felt like I was bringing my old life patterns and
needs with me into the woods and in so doing finding myself unable to adopt the
patterns and habits of the woods itself. But I was certainly not deterred in my
quest and on such a quest sooner or later one is bound to end up in Iron River,
Michigan.</p>
<p>As I got off the bus, gathered my bags, and stepped into the dark parking lot,
I looked around, trying to get myself oriented. Down at the end of the parking
lot was a lone station wagon barely visible in the shadows. I walked toward it
with my fingers crossed. Soon I was able to make out &quot;Teaching Drum Outdoor
School&quot; written on the side in large balloon-like letters. A young women was
getting out of the car as I pulled up. We introduced ourselves, determining I
was in the right place, and soon my bags were in the car and we were passing
quickly out of the small town and into the woods as the first rays of dawn
streaked across the clouds.</p>
<p>I still felt like I was in a dream after the bus ride and the forrest around us
still seem surreal. But as the dawn broke down the shadows the experience felt
more and more real. We drove on empty roads through the woods of Michigan and
passed without fanfare into the woods of northern Wisconsin. The land here was
mostly flat, but rolled just enough to create a great patchwork of forests and
bogs and a great maze of lakes and creeks.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the school it was still quite early in the morning. The sun
was hidden by mostly cloudy skies but it had still risen only recently. We
pulled up the short driveway into the midst of a small collection of wooden
buildings that constituted the support center for the school. This was a
collection of administration buildings and homes for the small community of
people that supported the school. This group of 10-15 people were standing in a
small circle on a patch of grass as we drove in and began to disperse for the
days activities as I was getting myself out of the car and taking in the new
surroundings.</p>
<p>I quickly met Matt, a soft-spoken and smiling guy with long hair and a a full
woodsmans beard, who had been my main contact at the school so far and had been
in charge of organizing my visit to the school. He gave me a quick tour of the
support center, went over my gear and set me up with a new knife and a set of
wool long johns. After a quick nap I was back in the station wagon with a small
one-person canoe tied up top and Matt was driving me in search of the school&#39;s
seekers -- their way of talking about their students. I had come to this school
to visit for a week the current participants of the school&#39;s Wilderness Guide
Program - an 11-month wilderness immersion and living experience, and to see
for myself if returning to the school next year for the full program was
something I wanted to do.</p>
<p>Matt dropped me off at a boat launch on a large creek where I met 3 of the
current year&#39;s seekers who had come to pick up food dropped off by the support
center. These 3 seemed a bit worn out at first impression and wet and not
entirely warm on this chill morning, but they were in good spirits and quite
friendly. Introductions were quick as there seemed to be quite the interest to
return to camp. The seekers live as a group in the woods, removed as much as
possible for the year from the trappings of modern civilization. They are
learning to sustain the life of their community with what the earth provides in
the forest that surrounds them. The school considers its role to be one of
support and indirect guidance to the seekers and as such takes a hands off
approach as much as possible. The school&#39;s instructors - guides - don&#39;t live
with the seekers but visit frequently to help keep the experience on track.</p>
<p>After determining how to load myself and my backpacks worth of gear into the
small and very unstable canoe, the four of us were off paddling up the slowly
moving creek. It was slightly chilly and the mornings off-and-on-rain returned
with a drizzle. I felt incredibly excited to be there and the rain didn&#39;t
dampen my spirits in the slightest. I was finally able to feel myself relax
after the hectic travels. After a short while of paddling into the wind and the
rain the drizzle passed and soon we were hauling the canoes up on an unmarked
shore, hiding them in the trees and bushwhacking our way a bit farther up the
creek to the seekers current encampment.</p>
<p>I had learned earlier at the support center that the seekers were not at their
normal camp but were currently at a temporary camp set up to gather swamp grass
for the thatching of a wigwam they were constructing. They had just arrived at
this new camp a day or two before I joined them and had setup a loose
collection of small tarp shelters and lean-tos to house them for their time
there. With the break in the rain I setup my tent as quickly as possible then
joined a small group of the seekers around their fire as they divided up the
food that had just been picked up and started cooking a bit for lunch. It
seemed that most were waiting out the weather in their shelters and soon it
started raining again and I was in my tent taking my second much need nap of
the day.</p>
<p>I awoke late in the day to no rain and a bit of sun and joined in with wood
gathering for the evening fire. I met the rest of the seekers slowly as they
appeared mysteriously out of their tarps or the trees. There were 7 in total. 3
Americans, 2 from Germany, 1 from France and 1 from Ireland. Ages ranging from
19 to mid 40&#39;s. 3 women and 4 men. Quite an interesting and diverse group. I
settled in to watch and experience what it was that had drawn such different
people to the same little spot in the woods and what they were doing there
together.</p>
<p>Over the next 7 days I experienced a lot and learned even more. Learning to
make a life in the wilderness seems to be quite the transition. Going into the
visit I was thinking a year seemed like a long time to spend in the woods.
Coming out it is apparent it would merely be the first small step on a journey.
It was a rough week for the seekers. They were separated these seven days from
the home they had been building in the woods these past few months and faced
with the daunting prospect of gathering tremendous amounts of swamp grass from
the swamp that bordered our creek. They were at the tail end of the summer
hunger months so food was scarce. Tension and peace was washing over the group
like the tide. They were, as they told it, battling with the fourth threshold
of the wilderness experience - the relinquishing of personal ego in favor of
circle consciousness. One seeker found it too much at the time and moved on
while I was there. I helped out with the physical activities as much as I could
but found myself able only to watch the emotional dynamics play themselves out.
The seekers were all incredible, I can only hope that if I do this next year,
the next batch will be as cool is this one. When the time came for me to leave,
my feet were tired, my hands were scarred and bleeding, and my heart was happy.</p>
<p>The school&#39;s motto reads</p>
<blockquote>
<p>where wilderness is the classroom
ancient voices are the teachers
knowing self and balance are the quest</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Knowing the wilderness here is as much a means as it is an end. The scope of
what they are doing is much broader than &quot;learning survival skills&quot; or even
&quot;learning how to live in balance with the wild.&quot; The quest for self and its
harmonious co-existence with and in the the stormy billows of the world is one
with which I am familiar. But to pursue it outside the reach of insidiously
theoretical dusty old books and inside the experience of the real earth and
surrounded by relations of all types (humans, birds, chipmunks, trees, rocks
and rivers) that are also of the same pursuit seems a bit too much like a dream
come true.</p>
<p>Which makes me wonder, now that I&#39;m back in the world of glass and concrete and
electric lights, if the whole week was just a glimpse through the window of a
cross country bus by a sleep deprived mind of what my life might look like,
someday.</p>
