						<p>I survived survival school. Wew. That&#39;s good.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of surviving that goes on at survival school actually. In fact,
everyone survived.</p>
<p>Actually, whatever survival is, it played a pretty small role in the trip,
although I&#39;m sure everyone&#39;s experience was different. I would describe it as a
wilderness expedition designed to maximize connection to, and minimize
insulation from, the wilderness that one is expeditioning in.</p>
<p>There are three stories to tell from this experience. Okay, there are more, but
there are three that speak of some powerful moments and are certainly
highlights of my experience. One is about poop, one is about fire, and one is
about land.</p>
<p>POOP: Somewhere in the middle of this 14-day course we stopped walking for a
bit and setup a base camp of sorts for 2 days. During this time we slaughtered,
processed, and consumed a sheep, all done in the woods with little more than
our small knives and some cast iron. Part of this experience was educational:
learning how to respectfully, humanely and quickly do the slaughtering,
learning how to effectively clean and butcher the sheep, learning how to
preserve and prepare close to all of the edible portions of the sheep. Part of
this experience was experiential. A good number of us had never partaken in the
slaughtering and processing of the animals that we eat, and it is certainly a
powerful experience. To witness and partake in the transformation of a living
animal into a delicious, nourishing, and satisfying meal was to put myself into
direct contact with the flow of life from another being into myself.</p>
<p>The really magical moment, though, came the next morning. I had hiked up the
hill for my daily morning poop. I had done my business in a small hole and as
we had been taught, was mixing it into the soil to help kickstart the breaking
down and fertilization process.</p>
<p>I froze, shivers running up and down my spine. For lack of a better way of
putting this, I was experiencing myself as part of the circle of life and in a
very powerful way. I felt a deep connection with the flow of life and felt
myself as a part of it, or a conduit of it, or perhaps both. I had to stand
there for a couple minutes just staring at my hole of poop. All I could see was
the life of the sheep being transformed, yet again, into the life of the soil
and the life of the land. It was a life that I had helped to take, a life that
I had held onto for a little while, and a life that I was now passing back into
the greater web of the living land.</p>
<p>The idea of the circle of life, and the flow of energy through ecological
systems, is certainly something I&#39;ve been familiar with for some time. But, due
in a large part to the fact that in my regular life I have no direct experience
of where the life that sustains me comes from and no direct experience of what,
if anything, it nourishes when it leaves me, I had never had the experience of
actually being a part of the circle of life or an ecological system. So, that
was pretty cool.</p>
<p>FIRE: There are few things that define humans as much as our relationship with
fire. All of modern civilization was forged on our ability to create and
control flame. The transformative power of combustive heat is without equal.
Without it, our tools would be rocks, our houses would be sticks, and our food
would be cold.</p>
<p>We have so mastered the creation and control of fire that we can turn it on
with the flick of a wrist or thumb, the turning of a key, or the push of a
button. It is fully ingrained continuously in the fabric of our daily lives.</p>
<p>But what happens when we step out of our daily lives? Perhaps we step into
survival school where we don&#39;t have our prefabricated (with fire) matches or
lighters. Fire becomes hard and it becomes a big deal.</p>
<p>We had our bow drill fire lesson within the first couple days of the course.
Which, if you&#39;re unfamiliar, involves a fire board to be drilled into, a
spindle to do the drilling, and a bow to spin the spindle. The idea here is to
create a fine sawdust by drilling the wooden spindle into the board. The
sawdust falls into a notch cut into the board and when enough has accumulated
the speed of the drilling is increased to heat up the sawdust and turn it into
a coal. The coal can then be transferred to a tinder bundle and breathed into
fire. At least that is how it&#39;s supposed to work. The actuality of the thing is
a delicate balancing act of patience and perseverance because it takes some
time to get everything dialed in to the level of relative flawlessness needed
for the operation to succeed.</p>
<p>I tried unsuccessfully for the first couple nights, put it on hold during sheep
camp, and then we transitioned to the solo phase of the course. For the solo
phase of the course we each got our own small patch of land on which to be by
ourselves for two days. We each got a portion of food (oatmeal, quinoa,
lentils, a few veggies) and were left to our own devices. We started in the
evening, and after getting a quick shelter setup I immediately began working my
fire kit. I felt a certain amount of pressure. There wasn&#39;t a lot of light
left, I didn&#39;t want to eat uncooked lentil stew, and I hand&#39;t yet successfully
got a fire going. But I felt strangely confidant. I knew I had been close
before, and I was feeling that this would be an extremely excellent time for a
first fire.</p>
<p>I started afresh with a new hole in my fireboard (the fifth hole). I drilled in
a little ways with my spindle and cut my notch. It was time to go at it. At
first I was having trouble creating sawdust. I added some pine sap as
lubrication between the spindle and my top rock and also added a bit of sand
into the hole I was drilling into the board. The goal was to force as much
friction to the end of the spindle that was drilling into the board as
possible, while reducing the friction at the top of the spindle. It worked. I
started getting a lot of sawdust, sped up my strokes and the sawdust started
smoking. I had a coal! I carefully transferred it to my pre-made tinder bundle
and started giving it long slow breaths. After five or six of these there was
nothing left glowing in my tinder bundle. I&#39;d lost the coal.</p>
<p>Evening was coming on, and the pressure was building. Could I get this fire lit
before dark? I still felt confidant and knew I needed to stay calm if I was
going to succeed. I added some powdered and fibrous oak leaves to my tinder
bundle and some crushed up, dried out pine needles. I used the same hole on my
fire board and the coal came quickly. I did another careful transfer to my
tinder bundle and again started long slow breaths. This time I could see the
coal growing and passing on its glowing life to the other elements of the
tinder bundle. And it was starting to smoke, a lot, a good sign the fire was on
its way. I continued the long slow breaths and the smoke started pouring into
my eyes. I couldn&#39;t see and my eyes were burning, but I had to continue. A long
deep and powerful breath and I felt that my eyes were now actually burning
instead of just stinging from smoke. I moved the tinder bundle away from my
face and squinted open my eyes. I was holding fire in my hand! The tiny flames
were leaping around my tinder bundle quickly getting bigger. I transferred the
flaming mass into my fire pit and quickly nursed the tinder into a small but
powerful campfire.</p>
<p>I was ecstatic. And I was in disbelief. Partially at what I had accomplished,
but also at the effect it was having on me. I started this story talking about
how fire permeates modern human life. I can say now that not only does it
permeate our life, but it permeates our genes as well. Conjuring the spirit of
fire from the raw landscape struck an unexpectedly primal and deep seated chord
within me. I sat down, cooked my lentils, and gazed, mesmorized, into my fire,
basking in the radiance of the power I had unleashed.</p>
<p>[As a side note, if you ever find yourself breathing a tinder bundle to life,
hold the thing above the level of your face so as to avoid the discomfort of
smoke and flames in the eyes. :-)]</p>
<p>LAND: This section may also be titled place, or presence, or belonging, or
harmonious existing, or any number of other similar names, but it was the land
that tied it all together, and it was the land that was there for me to step
into, and it was the land that I became a part of, so this section is titled
land.</p>
<p>It was the last day of hiking, the day before we all began making our way to
our respective homes. It is hard for me to know what brought on this
experience. It could have been the days of constant hiking, it could have been
the distance I felt from the rat race, it could have been the constant living
in closer connection with the means of my existence, but what it felt like is
that I said, &quot;I am here, now&quot;, and the land said &quot;Welcome. You belong here,
now.&quot;</p>
<p>To describe this experience more is going to be difficult, but it was dominated
by two things. First, the constant monologue that defines my life ceased. That
little voice, the constant narrator and analyzer of existence finally shut his
trap, and in his place, a quiet stillness welled up inside of me. This
experience, of being in the flow, or being the moment, is one that I&#39;ve had at
various times before. Usually it will happen in an intense high focus activity
(like skiing) but sometimes it will also happen during quieter times as well.
It basically amounts to my minds acceptance to just be in whatever moment it
finds itself and not go willy-nilly thinking about other moments, or worse,
getting stuck in the meta-moment of moment analyzation.</p>
<p>This time, however, was a bit different in that there was a second factor.
Namely, it seemed like it was not just my own mind that was content and stoked
to experience itself in the exact moment it was in but something else as well
welcomed me into the moment and corroborated my existence in that place at that
time. The feeling I got was that it was the place, the land, the desert, that
accepted me into it, in effect saying that I was a part of that land as well.</p>
<p>This is what I&#39;ve been working towards. This is what my expeditions into the
wilderness are for. The feeling that not only do I belong on and in the land,
but that I am integrated with the workings of the land, and that my life is a
piece of the greater whole of the living earth.</p>
<p>This feeling lasted with me for most of the rest of the day. And to diminishing
degrees, it stays with me still. A small, but constant reminder that life is
everywhere, and everywhere it is connected.</p>
